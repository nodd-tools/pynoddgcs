# py-gcs-utils

Utilities for working with [NOAA NODD](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination) GCS in python.
  These utilities are intended as [opinionated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) tools for interacting with GCS for the purpose of [findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) open [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
  By adopting common conventions for data dissemination, we not only reduce the learning curve to comprehending dataset layout, but we empower automation for combining data and further dissemination, e.g. through [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/index).
